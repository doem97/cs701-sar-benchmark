# CS701 SAR Multi-Task Benchmark

Reference code for the CS701 team assignment. One ViT-B/16 backbone, two tasks on SAR images: **classify** the
image (9 classes) and **detect** its objects.

## 1. SAR Task Introduction

### 1.1 SAR Basics

![A radar sends microwave pulses sideways, records the echoes, and combines them along its flight path into one long virtual antenna](docs/sar_explainer.gif)

- **Active radar**: satellite or aircraft sends microwave pulses, records echoes. Works day, night, through clouds.
  Looks sideways.
- **Synthetic aperture**: echoes along the flight path combined into one long virtual antenna, so fine resolution.
- **Pixel = echo strength**: 8-bit grey, no colour. Metal and corners bright, calm water dark, grainy speckle.

### 1.2 Task

- Input: one SAR image. Output: its class + a box, class and score for each object.
- Each image: one class label, 1 or more boxes, all of that class.
- 9 classes: aircraft, airport, bridge, car, harbor, oil tank, playground, ship, wind turbine.
- Data, formats, release dates: [dataset card](https://huggingface.co/datasets/doem1997/cs701-sar-course-data).
  Rules: [Codabench](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/18271).
- Limits: one model; at most 130 M parameters in total (frozen ones count; this code: 106-107 M) and at most 40 M
  trainable (heads included: LoRA 21.0 M; full fine-tuning and from scratch, 106 M, are over); each image in once at
  ≤ 512 × 512 px; no ensembles, no test-time augmentation. Your report states parameters (total, trainable) and
  compute; full list on Codabench (Terms).

### 1.3 Metric

- Classification: macro-F1. Detection: COCO mAP.
- Ranking: **Δm**, mean relative change of macro-F1 and mAP vs a reference model (ViT + LoRA, the example command
  in 2.2; mean of 3 seeds):
  `Δm = 100% × ½ [(F1 − F1_ref) / F1_ref + (mAP − mAP_ref) / mAP_ref]`
- Δm = 0: as good as the reference. Δm > 0: better. ViT full fine-tuning: about +13 (over the trainable budget: an
  upper bound).

### 1.4 Small Objects

Half of all boxes are smaller than one 16 × 16 ViT patch (at 512 × 512 input).

![A close-up with the 16 px patch grid: wind turbines of 6-10 px and the 15.9 px median box are smaller than one patch](docs/patch_grid.png)

## 2. Quick Start

### 2.1 Install

```bash
conda create -n cs701bench python=3.12 -y && conda activate cs701bench
pip install -r requirements.txt   # CUDA 12.8 builds of torch 2.9.0 / torchvision 0.24.0
```

### 2.2 Train Baseline

```bash
python train.py --backbone vit --init pretrained --adapt lora   # the Δm reference; one run, about 50 min
bash run_all.sh                                                  # all eight runs, about 7 h
```

- Options: `--backbone vit|terramind`, `--init pretrained|scratch`, `--adapt full|lora|moelora`
  (`python train.py -h`).
- `--adapt full` and `--init scratch` train 106 M parameters: over the 40 M budget, for reference only.
- Pretrained weights download from Hugging Face on first use (ViT 0.4 GB, TerraMind 1.5 GB).
- Times for one RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPU. Memory: [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md#time-and-memory).

### 2.3 Use Course Data

TA Zichen ran this code on fully labelled data in another folder layout. For the
[course data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/doem1997/cs701-sar-course-data), adapt `sarbench/data.py` and `train.py`:

- train on `train/labels.csv` + `train/instances.json`
- hold out part of train for local validation (val and test have no labels)
- predict on the images in `val/images.json` and `test/images.json`

### 2.4 Make Submission

`make_submission.py` has `write_submission` (the function in the briefing video): maps your boxes back to
original image pixels, writes `submission.zip` for Codabench.

## 3. Baseline Results (for reference)

Test split, %, mean ± std over 3 seeds. Δm reference: ViT + LoRA, mean of its 3 seeds (93.99 / 25.41), so its Δm
is 0. Full fine-tuning and from scratch train 106 M parameters with the heads: over the 40 M budget, shown for
reference (full fine-tuning: the upper bound).
